# Present_cipher
PRESENT is a block cipher based on a ​SP-network​ and consists of 31 rounds. Itencrypts 64-bit blocks with a key with a length of 80 or 128 bits. 80-bit keyimplementation is satisfactory for low-security applications typically required intag-based deployments.
Here we are using a 80 bit key.
